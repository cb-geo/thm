# SogaGeothermalHPC

This is an open-source code based on DealII for geothermal simulation. The code is developed by Prof. Kenichi Soga's group in UC Berkleey. The target is to apply the code in city-scale geotermal exploitation simulation and analyze the effects of geotermal exploitation on the under ground environment.
